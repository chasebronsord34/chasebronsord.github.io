	<H2> <B>Hiking</B> </H2>
		<p> There are not many peaks near my hometown, however my friends and I frequently 
	explore the parks and various hills/mountains around town. One popular spot is 
	Talcott Mountain, featuring fantastic views of the entire town of Simsbury, and a
	brisk 30 minute ascent to the top. Since coming to Maine for college, Acadia National
	Park is a spot that I have wanted to go to very badly. Unfortunately without a car 
	it is difficult to find a way up there, however once the day finally comes,
	it will definitely be worth the wait. </p>
	
	<H3> <B> Drawing</B> </H3>
		<p> Throughout my entire high school career I was involved in the art program. 
		Art is something that is very important to me, as it is a way to express yourself
		and capture life through a lens that you maybe would not otherwise. I try to 
		keep my sketchbook with me at all times, so that I can feel free to draw whenever 
		I may please. </p>
		
	<H4> <B>Swimming</B> </H4>
		<p> One of my favorite things to do is to take a nice dip in the pool. I learned 
		how to swim at a very young age, and since then it has been an activity that I 
		have always engaged in in order to relax, cool off and have fun. It is convenient 
		for me as we have a pool at my house and that is most likely a main reason as to 
		why I developed a love for the water. </p>
		
	<H5> <B>Memes</B> </H5>
		<p> Some may call me ahead of my time, some may say that I am too edgy,
		I call myself a connoisseur. I have an eye for dank memes, and have an extensive
		collection at my disposal. While this is not the most useful of skills,
		I would argue that meme literacy is as, if not more, important than street smarts
		and book smarts. To me it is all about a balance of abilities, and with an 
		extensive knowledge of memes you have the internet, and therefore the world at
		your disposal. </p>
