<H1> About Me </H1>
	<link HREF="aboutme.css" rel="stylesheet">
	<p> My name is Chase Bronsord, I am 18 years old and study at the University of Maine. 
		I am originally from Simsbury Connecticut, where I lived with my parents, 
		sister and two dogs. </p>
		
		<p> I have travelled to various places around the world, and those experiences
		have helped me to gain a different viewpoint on the world. I have been to Jamaica 
		twice, and both times it was one of the most wonderful experience in my life.
		It has helped me to understand that many problems I have are trivial, as the 
		natives do not have nearly as much as I do and they are happy with their lives.
		When I was 13, I went to Italy, specifically Rome, Florence, and Venice.
		These places are some of the most intriguing places in the world and are full of 
		history, culture and art. These experiences have given me motivation to want to 
		be able to travel all around the world. </p>
